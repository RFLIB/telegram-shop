In this project i created a super group in which we have certain users. A start menu displayed infont of every user in the group:

Whenever the user press the start button, the bot sends a menu to the user privately:

After the user chooses one of the three products, we ask about the quantity:

After that we ask the user if he wishes to continue the purchase. If he does, we repeat the process, in he doesnt, we finish it:

In the example i exported the orders into txt file, but i add dbhelper which you can use to export the orders into db file:
